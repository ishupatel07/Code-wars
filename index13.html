    <p>
        Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

    <script>
        function countSheeps(sheep) {
  // TODO
  let num = 0
  
  for (let i = 0; i < sheep.length; i++){
    if(sheep[i] == true){
        num++
    }
  }
    return num
}
    </script>
