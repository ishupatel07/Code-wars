    <title>Thinkful - Logic Drills: Traffic light</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

        Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.
        
        For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.
    </p>


    <script>
        function updateLight(current) {
  
  //your code here!
  
  if (current === 'green'){
    current = 'yellow'
  } else if (current === 'yellow') {
    current = 'red'
  } else if (current === 'red') {
    current = 'green'
  }
  
  return current

}



function updateLight(current) {
  var dict = {'green' : 'yellow', 
              'yellow' : 'red', 
              'red' : 'green'};
  return dict[current];
}
    </script>
