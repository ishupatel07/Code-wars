    <title>Are You Playing Banjo?</title>

<body>
    <p>
        Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
        If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

        The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:
    
        name + " plays banjo" 
        name + " does not play banjo"
    
    </p>

    <script>
            function areYouPlayingBanjo(name) {
  return name + (name[0].toLowerCase() == 'r' ? ' plays' : ' does not play') + " banjo";
}
    </script>
</body>
