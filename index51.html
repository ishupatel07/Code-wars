    <p>
        Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

    <script>
        
const vowels = 'aeiou';

function disemvowel(str) {
  return str
    .split('')
    .filter(letter => !vowels.includes(letter.toLowerCase()))
    .join('');
}
    </script>
