    <title>Find the first non-consecutive number
    </title>
</head>

<body>

    <p>Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

        By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

        E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's
        the first non-consecutive number.

        If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

        The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be
        unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be
        either too!</p>

    <script>
        function firstNonConsecutive(arr) {
            for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; ++i) {
                if (arr[i] + 1 !== arr[i + 1]) {
                    return arr[i + 1]
                }
            }
            return null
        }


        function firstNonConsecutive(arr) {
            let num = arr[0];
            for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                if (num != arr[i]) {
                    return arr[i];
                }
                num++;
            }
            return null;
        }
    </script>
