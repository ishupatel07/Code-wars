        Remove First and Last Character</title>

        It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry about strings with less than two characters.

    <script>
        function removeChar(str) {
  return str.slice(1, -1);
}
    </script>
    
</body>
